# Main directory of python source code

This has two modules:

## fpg

These are Floating Point Group provided files that serve as the underlying infrastructure and  methods of running strategies.

Mostly this folder can be ignored.

## strategies

In each folder there is one file:
- `<strategy>.py` - Defines the strategy, and logic of buying/selling.

To create/run a new strategy, make a new folder here and update the files appropriately.
